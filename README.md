The goal in this Project is to get a json with employee data in each json and to seperate the the big json into smalls json that will be pushed into mongo db
1) get the data from json and make manipulation of this data
2) separate the big json into smaller json when:
   - first type: json for one employee with the modification
   - second type: json for mutual friends between each of the friends that was in the original big json
3) insert the json into MongoDB
4) receive other json and make a query on mongo by index to see if the data exist on db and if it's exist update the json on mongo
